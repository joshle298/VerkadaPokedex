# VerkadaPokedex

👋 Hey there, I'm Joshua Le! Thank you for giving me the unique opportunity to showcase my skillset in a take-home iOS project as a part of the interview process at Verkada. This project works right out of the box and should be easy to clone and open up _(but if you run into any problems please contact me at joshua.le@nyu.edu)_.

## Demo

### ✅ Milestone 1:
- Created a (Verkada) Pokedex app that successfully calls PokéAPI for a list of our respective Pokemon and shows them in a three column grid layout
- When a Pokemon tile is tapped, a details page is presented specific to that Pokemon (further implmentation needed for specific details)

### ✅ Milestone 2:
- I'll give this milestone a "work-in-progress" status. As you can see in the demo video, the next 21 populated Pokemon are only called when the page is pulled up to refresh. I attempted to implement pagination when scrolling down but could not find a way to with my current LazyVStack layout--the use of Tabs and Lists seemed like an easier approach for this milestone.

### ✅ Milestone 3:
- Successfully implmented image caching with the help of a third-party library, [CachedAsyncImage](https://github.com/lorenzofiamingo/swiftui-cached-async-image)
